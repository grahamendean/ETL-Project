# ETL Project


The NFL has multiple positions that are able to affect the game in a major way.  The three most game changing plays are sacks, interceptions, and touchdowns.  Our group is taking NFL statistics from 1989 to present to find which positions have the most interceptions/sacks. We are also taking the data to find who has the most touchdowns from a certain season.
